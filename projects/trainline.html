      <p>I joined the Trainline mobile team at the start of 2015, when they already had apps in both the iOS App Store and the Play Store, but lacked customer satisfaction with an average rating of 2 stars.</p>

      <p>A key value that we noticed that would set Trainline apart from the competitor apps like National Rail and all train specific apps was to be customer focused. While it was important to be driving ticket sales it was also recognised that delivering a great product that provided help when not looking to purchase would strengthen the brand and support this key value.</p>

      <h3>What we see at the station...</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest parts of confusion we observed for commuters was the disconnect from what they saw on the platform to what they could find in the app.</p>

      <p>...can be hard to make sense of</p>
      <p>Train stations display a lot of information and when you know what you're looking for, it can work ok. But when you need a stop that's on a unfamiliar route you're almost forced to ask a station guard or loose valuable time making sense of it, making us consider how do we bring this knowledge to our users.</p>

      <h3>Regular user testing and team playbacks</h3>
      <p>A big part of what I enjoyed with the Trianline was the recognition in valuing regular user testing and gathering as many real world users experiences as possible.</p>

      <p>We would strive to test in as real scenerios as possible, this meant anything from the existing app to see what parts caused any friction to flat designed Marvel prototypes for new concepts to working code prototypes.</p>

      <p>All findings and customer experiences where relayed to whole the team to support rational going forward.</p>

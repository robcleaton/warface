Engage and empower patients to take active steps to prevent their risk of stroke

A solution to engage and empower patients to take active steps to prevent their risk of stroke.

I was approached by Helicon Health to help design a system that would positivly engage with patients and support the needs of the clinic. Working together for 6 months I was responsible for faciliating regular user testing, liasing with clinics as well as to reporting to stakeholders.

Through the course of the project we conducted extensive user research, produced a brand identity and a user experience that we had 100% confidence in from being user centric.

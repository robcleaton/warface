  <p>Thereâ€™s been loads of prototyping tools on the market over the past few years. From static click through prototyping tools like Marvel, InVison and Flinto to name only a few, there are now a growing number of fully interactive prototypes appearing like Framer, Principle, Adobe XD. All have pros and cons and I certainly see merit in most based on the project.</p>

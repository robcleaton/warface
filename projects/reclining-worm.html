<p>Recliningworm is a personal project I've been leisurely working on out of office hours and in personal time to develop my illustration style and skills. I'm a big believer in personal projects in pursuing passion and shaping a personal identity and love the serendipity that comes with new opportunities and people to meet along the way.</p>

<p>Most illustrations here are many of my heroes from the 90's as a child.</p>

<p>Pins and stickers available from my Recliningworm etsy store</p>
